* Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance attributed to a non-random amount of variance
* The slope of this linear model is **not** considered to be zero due to a very low p-value of 5.35e-11
* With a multiple R-Squared value of .71, this model has a strong Pearson's correlation and predicts the MechaCar Prototype's MPG effectively

* The total summary of PSI data falls within the acceptable limits of variance
  > 62.3 is less than the maximum allowed variance of 100
* Lots 1 and 2 have very low variance with consistent Means and Medians
* Lot 3 has a deviating Mean and Median and its level of variance and fails to meet design specifications
  > A variance of ~170 exceeds the maximum of 100

* Taken as a whole, there is no statistical difference between the presumed population mean of 1500PSI and the observed data
* However, considering each lot individually, there is a statistical difference between the presumed and observed PSI Mean from Lot 3 -- its p-value of .04 is under the signifcance level of .05
